Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a 
berry tree which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest 
there lived a crocodile and his wife. 

One day crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the berry tree.
The monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more
fruits as he loved them. As days passed by monkey and crocodile became good friends.

One day monkey sent some fruits for crocodile's wife, she ate the fruits and liked them but was
jealous as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey. So, she told her
husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet monkey's heart would be? Get me 
the heart of the monkey". Crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but had no choice.
